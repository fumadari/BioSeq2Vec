Transformer-based model to encode biological sequences into dense vector representations


# BioSeq2Vec: Encoding Biological Sequences via Transformer-based Representation Learning

## Overview

BioSeq2Vec is a project designed to represent biological sequences (DNA, RNA, protein) as dense vector embeddings using Transformer-based models. The goal is to learn meaningful representations that capture the biological properties of sequences, inspired by natural language processing techniques.

## Features

- Transformer-based model tailored for biological sequences.
- Preprocessing tools for handling FASTA files.
- Training scripts with configurable hyperparameters.
- Evaluation scripts for assessing embedding quality.
- Visualization tools for embeddings.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains sample data and data loading scripts.
- **src/**: Core source code including model definition, training, and utilities.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis.
- **results/**: Stores results like embeddings and plots.
- **configs/**: Configuration files for the project.

## Setup Instructions

### Clone the Repository
